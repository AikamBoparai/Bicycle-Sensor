# Bicycle-Sensor-Prototype

A project designed to increase the safety of bicycle riders with concerns to vehicles and pedestrians.

## Hardware
-Texas Instruments MSP430FR4133 Microprocessor (https://www.ti.com/tool/MSP-EXP430FR4133)

-2 Ultrasonic sensors. For the back and front (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15569)

-Mosfets to convert from 3.3V to 5V and vice-versa. This is neccessary because the ultrasonic sensors need 5 volt inputs however the microprocessor can only handle a 3.3V signal. Providing 5V to the microprocessor can potentially damage the pins on the launchpad
